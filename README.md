## Synopsis

HARP is cross-platform application for automating the processing of Î¼CT and OPT image data.

## Motivation

HARP was primarily developed for members of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), for standardisation of embryo images prior to export to the PhenoDCC.
However, it is free for anyone to use and is capable of processing other image modalities and specimens.

## Installation

HARP can be downloaded as a standalone release which can be run simply by double-clicking **harp.exe**. The latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/mpi2/HARP/releases/latest).
